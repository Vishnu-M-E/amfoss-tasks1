# Self Introduction
Hey,  
I'm Vishnu Mohandas a Compouter Science Engineering student (CSE). I've been fascinated with coding ever since the first "Hello World" program in Python. I've always been fascinated by latest innovations and discoveries in the tech world. From quantum computers to Machine Learning and the curent buzz word AI. The satisfaction and rush I get from coding and solving problems is phenomenal. I hope to learn and understand new languages, methods and mucuh more.

# Why you should choose me
I've always loved to just sit down with a problem and find the most easiest and effective way to solve it. I'm excited and thrilled to work on projects, learn new skills and concepts, and have fun in the process. I'm confident that I can contribute to the club, help push it forward and achieve greater success.

# Goals for the next 6 months
I've been wanting to learn Object Oriented Programming and it's applications, and also master c++. Also looking to explore the various domains in Computer Science to find something I'm interested in.

# How I'll contribute back to the club
